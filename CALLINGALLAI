Artificial Intelligence GitHub Repository
This is the folder where you can learn all the basics of coding for robotics!
There's files to understanding syntax and basic concepts and the different possibilities in robotics, if anything is unclear feel free to ask any questions to any of the programmers.
Enjoy! :)
